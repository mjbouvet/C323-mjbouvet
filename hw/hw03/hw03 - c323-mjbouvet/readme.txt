For this assignment I implemented all the required operations: add, divide, subtract, multiply as well as functionality
for the enter symbol and AC, mr, mc, m+, m-, and the change sign button. I learned the coding to make the buttons work the 
way they do and the constraint method from Luke Klein in office hours. I recieved the method to convert binary to decimal
and vice-versa from the link given in the code. A memory stored button could improve the calculator. I don't have
any questions about the tasks.
