I completed all parts of the assignment, i.e. storyboard, view controller, table view controller, custom cells, etc.

(c)
The only things that I struggled with were figuring out the connection to the custom cell, but this was a simple issue all
I was doing was changing the identifier of the cell in the wrong spot and after I found this it was an easy fix, and getting
the program not to print the same thing over and over which required creating a second array and getting rid of multiple hits
in the same pre-created word categories. I don't even think this was required for the assignment but it made it look nicer and
felt good when I got it to work this way.
