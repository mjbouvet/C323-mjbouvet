Parts I Completed/Interesting Parts:
- I personally completed the code to implement the guess counter and the intersting code
would be the button that resets the values and restarts the game

-I believe the team divided the work fairly. Darsh, Matt, and I were the only ones in the group
and we wrote the code for the app and had it done before Adam joined the team so he did not 
write the code but he did the UML design so he contributed a fair share. Matt and Darsh also
worked on the comments on the code after I implemented the history counter and restart button.
