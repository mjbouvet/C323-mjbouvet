My app is an exploration game in which you can either choose to play a surivival based world or a creative sandbox world with unlimited resources in which you can 
build whatever you want and you can switch between the modes using a developer console. The problem is important because people are out of stuff to do because of 
corona so this gives them another game to play. That is also the solution and people should care because they need some joy in their life now that  they can't
leave their  house. :)
